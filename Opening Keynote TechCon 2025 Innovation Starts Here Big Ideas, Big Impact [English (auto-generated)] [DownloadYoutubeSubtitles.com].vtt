here today's team encapsulate four

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.320
powerful elements so techcon is based on

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.520
four building blocks Investments

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320
Innovation inspiration and influence

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.799

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.680
future you will have a inspiration panel

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.159
Cooper who made the first cell phone

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.479

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.240
Bell moment for In Our Lifetime

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.240
so we have speakers that Traverse a wide

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.840
spectrum of experiences and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.560
domains these four pillars that are the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.879
founding principles of techcon are the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720
pillars that drive that every Innovation

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.000
that you see you need you need

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.360
innovators you need Investments and you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.599
need Visionaries who Define the future

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.400
they all have to come together and if

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.720
you look at every startup whether it's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.800
two people in a room with no windows or

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.160
a large organization a Fortune 500 that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.560
was a startup long time back it all

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.400
starts with the same way every

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.959
investment that fuels progress every

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.800
Innovation that drives us forward it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.120
happens when people come together and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.400
they exchange

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.080
ideas but more importantly these are the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080
elements that drive us to gather here

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.760
today and our goal is to learn to share

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.760
and to grow

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.239

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.319

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.560
this event

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.160

will drive the discussions for the next

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.960
two days and shape our

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.360
future I will encourage you to take full

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.160

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.240
networking opportunity that you will see

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.680
whether it's in person we have a nice

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.160
app I would highly recommend connect

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.600
through that and um reach out to people

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.400

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.880
be your next co-founder maybe your next

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.120
investor or maybe your next big

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.560
inspiration so I will say look around on

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.479
your left right in front and try to at

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.120
least meet one new person by before this

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.440
session

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.400
ends so now how did we make this happen

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.680
so just like any other ini initiative

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.479
that you have I will have to acknowledge

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.280
the team that's behind this it's it's a

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.759
it's a committed set of individuals that

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.919
get together together with a vision and

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.160
then make it

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.000
happen so this wouldn't be have been

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.160
possible without the organizers which

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.960
I'll be introducing very soon the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.120

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.919
also the sponsors which we're going to

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.000
recognize in more detail tomorrow

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.160
without their help this will not have

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.440
been possible it started with a dream

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.120
and every dream when it becomes a

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.840
reality you have to look back and say

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.560
who are the people who made it happen so

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.479
let's give them a big round of applause

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.280

possible it's about being inspired and

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.479
inspiring others it's about creating a

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.840
